Write a function named `ft_scanf` that will mimic the real scanf with the following constraints:

- It will manage only the following conversions: s, d, and c
- You don't have to handle the options *, m and '
- You don't have to handle the maximum field width
- You don't have to handle the types modifier characters (h, hh, l, etc.)
- You don't have to handle the conversions beginning with %n$

Your function must be declared as follows:

int ft_scanf(const char *, ... );

You will find in this directory a file containing a part of the code you will need, you just have to complete it.

To test your program compare your results with the real scanf.

Hint : You may need to read the man of scanf.
